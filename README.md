# SF2_SEAC_20200329

Special Force 2 SDK 1.0.199003.0
Base only, without functioning hack.

## TODO

 1. Search for Name and Object, add them back into SDK Header.
 2. Search for PE Index and modify the VirtualFunction in Core_Classes.
 3. Create a injector, Kernel Injection is recommended.
 4. Entrypoint is removed, create one. (Do not use CreateThread because EAC will slap the shit out of you)

## Misc

The reason why I don't include a Kernel Injector is because some faggot will probably leech it and claim he made it, just like how he did on a shitty game run by CiB Net Station.
